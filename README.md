# Vehicle-Detection-System
Detect the cars present in the images or videos. Compare the traditional and modern vehicle detection approaches. The first approach uses the HOG algorithm to generate feature vectors and an SVM classifier with 96% accuracy. The second approach uses the pre-trained YOLO_TINY Convolutional Neural Network with 99.98% accuracy and 40% reduced processing time.
